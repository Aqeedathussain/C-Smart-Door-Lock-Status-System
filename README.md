# C++ Smart Door Lock Simulation

A simple C++ program that simulates a smart door lock system using class-based design.  
This project focuses on input validation, state handling, and tracking invalid access attempts.

---

## Features
- Accepts user input for door lock/unlock status  
- Validates input to allow only predefined states  
- Tracks and displays failed input attempts  
- Displays current door status clearly  

---

## Concepts Used
- Classes & Objects  
- Input validation using loops  
- Conditional statements  
- State management within a class  

---

## How to Run
1. Integrate the class into a `main.cpp` file  
2. Compile using:  
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o smart_doorlock
